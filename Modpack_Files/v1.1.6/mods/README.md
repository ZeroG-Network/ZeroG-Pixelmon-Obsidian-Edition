Pixelmon is to large to upload to the repository.

Really simple way to install the mod, head over to this [link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelmon),
Drop it into this folder and you can start your game.

I would recommend using [this](https://github.com/ZeroG-Network/ZeroG-Pixelmon-Obsidian-Edition/blob/main/Manafests/ZeroG-Pixlemon%20Obsidian%20Edition-1.1.4.zip), the info on how to install this is simple and is given in the README.MD in the [Manafests](https://github.com/ZeroG-Network/ZeroG-Pixelmon-Obsidian-Edition/tree/main/Manafests) folder.
